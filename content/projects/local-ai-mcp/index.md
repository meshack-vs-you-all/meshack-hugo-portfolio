Bridging the gap between local data privacy and powerful Large Language Models using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
{{< /lead >}}

## Project Overview

This initiative focuses on the practical application of **Agentic AI** — specifically, integrating LLMs with local tools and data without compromising privacy. I have worked extensively with custom MCP servers to allow models like **DeepSeek** and **Llama 3** to interact with:

- Local file systems
- Self-hosted databases
- Internal APIs
- Home automation systems

## Technical Integration

The architecture utilizes **n8n** for autonomous workflows and standardized MCP servers for tool definitions. This allows for a robust, local-first AI ecosystem that can handle complex tasks while keeping sensitive data on-premise.
