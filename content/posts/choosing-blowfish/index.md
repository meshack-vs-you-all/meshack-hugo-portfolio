When building this portfolio, I needed a theme that was **fast**, **accessible**, and **visually stunning**. Enter [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/).

## Key Features

{{< alert "twitter" >}}
**Blowfish** is a fork of the popular Congo theme, but with superpowers.

### 1. Native Tailwind CSS
Styling is a breeze. The entire theme is built on Tailwind, meaning I can customize anything without fighting a rigid CSS structure.

### 2. Rich Shortcodes
As a developer, I need to express complex ideas. Blowfish provides tools for that:

**Code Blocks with Copy Button**
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Blowfish!")
    return True
```

**Badges for Skills**

### 3. Automatic Dark Mode
Check the toggle in the footer. The theme handles system preferences out of the box.

## Performance
Because it's Hugo, it's blazing fast. Static site generation means:
- **0ms** database lookups.
- **Instant** page loads.
- **<1s** Time to Interactive.

## Conclusion
If you're a developer looking for a portfolio theme that respects your time and your code, give Blowfish a try.
