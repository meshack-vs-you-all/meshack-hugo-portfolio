I used to think being a "Senior" meant I could write the most clever, optimized standard library replacement in C. I was wrong.

## 1. Code is a Liability

Every line of code you write is a line that needs to be debugged, tested, and maintained.
**Junior**: "I wrote 500 lines of code to solve this."
**Senior**: "I deleted 500 lines of code and solved it."

## 2. Problem Finding vs Problem Solving

Juniors are given tickets. Seniors find the problems that generate the tickets.

**Example**: Instead of fixing the same bug 5 times, a Senior Engineer pauses to refactor the broken module that causes it.

## 3. Communication

You interpret technical constraints for business stakeholders.
-   **Bad**: "We can't do that, the O(N) complexity is too high."
-   **Good**: "We can do that, but it will slow down checkout by 3 seconds and cost $500/month more."

## 4. Mentorship

If you are the smartest person in the room, you are failing your team. Your job is to elevate everyone else. Force multiply your knowledge.
