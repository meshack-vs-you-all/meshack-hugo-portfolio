{{< lead >}}
I'm a software engineer based in Nairobi, building systems that solve real problems for real businesses. I specialize in full-stack web development with a bias toward **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **React** — always containerized, always production-ready.

## My Approach

I don't build prototypes — I build systems. Every project I take on follows the same principles:

1. **Production from day one** — Docker, CI/CD, migrations, and monitoring are never afterthoughts.
2. **Ethical engineering** — Rate limiting, robots.txt compliance, and clear user agent identification are built into every scraper. Data handling follows best practices.
3. **Business-aware architecture** — Technical decisions serve business goals. If a simpler stack solves the problem, I use the simpler stack.
